1)  A constructor can be referred as special type of setter
where the name is that of a class name and it is invoked 
during the object creation and also it  doesn't have any 
explicit return type.
2)  If there is a call to constructor and programmer has 
not included any constructor in a class then java compiler 
include a default constructor.
3)  However, progrmmer has included any constructor, weather 
is parameterized or zero parameterized, then javac would not 
include any default cinstructor.
"Using public access specifier is recommended to the constructor"
